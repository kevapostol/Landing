            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Kanvas is a professional networking site for both Software
                Engineer students and entry level developers. You can make
                connections, share posts, and job search all in one place. It is
                true that you can succeed most and quickest by helping others to
                succeed.​​ We created Kanvas because we wanted to reframe the
                process of building a career. Climbing up the ladder is great,
                but it doesn't encompass all the different experiences each
                person has. It's not only linear. It's more than climbing to the
                top. Think of your career as a work of art. Each move is
                synonymous to the increment movements you make to create a
                masterpiece.
